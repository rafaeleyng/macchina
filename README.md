Macchina
--------

A Finite States Machine to track properties that change over time.

## Install

```
npm install macchina
```

## Usage

You can use Macchina to organize whatever code that looks like you are transitioning between a bunch of different *states* (think of a state here as *the way the things are in a particular moment*).

For instance, you can organize a piece of UI, like a form that may have some different states, i.e., how it looks/works in different moments like before submitting, while is being submitted and after submission. Macchina allow you to work declaratively with your UI.


## Step by step explanation

1. Define your UI states in a piece of paper or in your head. You have to define the possible states of your UI (and give a name for each state) and the transitions between them:

1. Transpose your UI states to Javascript code. Use `properties` to describe how you want things look/behave (note that you have to define a state called `'start'`, that will be the first state called):

  ```javascript
  const states = [
    {
      name: 'start',
      properties: {
        showUserForm: true,
        statusText: 'Create your user',
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'save',
      callback: cb => {
        userService.save()
          .then(() => cb('done'))
      },
      properties: {
        showLoader: true,
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'done',
      properties: {
        showUserForm: true,
        statusText: 'User created!',
      },
    },
  ]
  ```

1. Initialize your Macchina instance, passing the states:

  ```javascript
  const macchina = new Macchina(states)
  ```

1. Bind Macchina state transitions to appropriate UI actions:

  ```javascript
  saveButton.addEventListener('click', () => macchina.transition('save'))
  ```

## Main concepts

Only 3: states, properties and transitions


### states

When defining a state, you can pass the following configurations:

```javascript
{
  name: 'theStateName',
  callback: () => { /* some code */}, // or 'nextStateName'
  timeout: milliseconds,
  properties: {},
}
```

- `name`: uniquely identifies the state inside this Macchina instance. Used in transitionsÂ to specify the target state.

- `callback`:
  - a function that will be executed immediately (or after `timeout` delay) when the Macchina instance is transitioned to this state. Inside this function, you can:
    - perform any custom logic and take a callback to make an asynchronous transition, like after receiving data from AJAX. Just call the callback passing the target state name
    - perform any custom logic and return a state name to make a synchronous transition
  - or a string, with the name of the state to where you want to transition to, synchronously. Equivalent to `function() { return 'nextStateName' }``

- `timeout`: if specified, it will delay the call to the state callback. For instance, if you want to stay in a state for 5 seconds (showing a message, or something) and then automatically transition to another, you can set `timeout: 5000` and `callback: 'targetStateName'`.

- `properties`: properties that will be set in the macchina when this is the current state. See section on properties.

You can get the current state name by calling `macchina.state()`.


## properties

You should only set the properties values that you want defined in a particular state. All properties values not specified in that state will be `undefined`.

```javascript
const states = [
  {
    name: 'saving',
    properties: {
      showLoader: true,
      showMessage: true,
      message 'Wait while saving...'
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'done',
    properties: {
      showUserForm: true,
      showMessage: true,
      message 'Success!'
    }
  },
  // ...
]
```

This will generate a `properties` object inside the Macchina instance, like bellow, whose values will be updated correctly at each state:

```javascript
{
  showLoader: undefined,
  showUserForm: undefined,
  showMessage: undefined,
  message: undefined
}
```

Note that **all properties names are arbitrary values** - you should name them anything that makes sense for you.  When you want `false` values you actually don't have to specify, since Macchina will automatically set unspecified values to `undefined`, which is a *falsy* value.

When you transition to any state, the properties values specified in that state will be set, and everything else will be `undefined`. In the state named `'done'`, properties would be:

```javascript
{
  showLoader: undefined,
  showUserForm: true,
  showMessage: true,
  message 'Success!'
}
```

The way to consume these properties is call `macchina.properties().showLoader` etc. Be wise enough to not modify the returned object.

Note that Macchina won't show or hide the user form or change anything in your UI by itself. It will only keep track of the properties values for each state and take care of synchronous and asynchronous transitions between the states. To actually change things in your UI you should write code to do that (by consuming `macchina.properties()` and acting appropriately) or use some data-binding framework.


## transitions

There are 5 ways to transition between states. A transition can happen automatically (like by timeout or after a network request is done) or by user action.

### `callback` property to perform automatic transitions

There are 3 ways to use the property `callback` to configure callbacks that are called immediately after transitioning to a state (or after `timeout`)

1. set the state `callback` property to a string with the state name.

  This is useful basically for better organizing your code. All the state will do is to call the next. Is equivalent to having a function that simply returns the next state name.

  ```javascript
  {
    name: 'start', // mandatory state name, is the first state that Macchina will call
    callback: 'myFirstActualState'
  }
  ```

1. set the state `callback` property to a function that `return 'myNextStateName'`.

  This is the way to go if all you want to do in a state is to **perform some synchronous task** and then transition to another state.

  ```javascript
  {
    name: 'start', // mandatory state name, is the first state that Macchina will call
    callback: () => {
      // do stuff
      return 'myFirstActualState'
    }
  }
  ```

1. set the state `callback` property to a function that receives and invokes a callback function passing the next state as a parameter.

  This is the way to go if all you want to do in a state is to **perform some asynchronous task** and then transition to another state.

  ```javascript
  {
    name: 'start', // mandatory state name, is the first state that Macchina will call
    callback: cb => {
      someAsyncCall().then(() => cb('myFirstActualState'))
    }
  }
  ```

### transitions API

There are 2 ways to perform transitions to respond to user input

1. `macchina.transition(stateName)`

  This is the way to go **to handle user input**, like going to next state when the user clicks the "Next" button. But note: this method will only work if your current state won't perform any automatic transition (caused by the `timeout` property). See `macchina.immediateTransition`.

  ```javascript
  saveButton.addEventListener('click', () => macchina.transition('performingSave'))
  ```

1. `macchina.immediateTransition(stateName)`

  This is the way to go **to cancel an automatic transition** (via the `timeout` property) **and make a transition to happen immediately**. For instance,  want to show a message for 5 seconds and dismiss it. You can create a state for that with  `timeout: 5000` and `callback: 'nextStateName'`. But you can provide a button "Dismiss now", and call `immediateTransition('nextStateName')` when that button is clicked. This means "I know that there's a timeout going on, so cancel it and perform this transition instead".

  ```javascript
  dismissButton.addEventListener('click', () => macchina.immediateTransition('afterWelcome'))
  ```

## Public API

Only the constructor + 4 methods:

### `new Macchina(states)`
Creates a new instance of a states machine.
* `states`: `[ {} ]`. array of objects containing states configuration.
**Returns:** `{}`. `Macchina` instance.

### `macchina.state()`
**Returns:** `String`. Name of current state.

### `macchina.properties()`
**Returns:** `{}`. Object containing merged properties from all states, but with only the values configured for the current state set.

### `macchina.transition(stateName)`
Perform a transition to the desired state. All properties will be correctly set and callback will be called, if defined. W
* `stateName`: `String`. Name of target state.

### `macchina.immediateTransition(stateName)`
// TODO
* `stateName`: `String`. Name of target state.
